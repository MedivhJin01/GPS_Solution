# GPS_Solution
GPS_BestRoute_Calculator
This is a software solution for the computation of the shortest path from one place to another place in a two dimensional space similar to a global positioning system (GPS). The vision of the project is that given the map of a region and its road connectivity and to compute the shortest path to go from one place to another place.


Graph: The region map with its road connectivity shown in the diagram above is called a graph.
Vertex: A vertex (plural vertices) is a unit in a graph.
Edge: A unit in a graph that connects pairs of vertices of the graph.
Path: A route to go from one vertex of a graph to another following the edges in the graph.
Origin Vertex of an edge: A vertex from where an edge emanates.
Destination Vertex of an edge: A vertex where an edge ends.
